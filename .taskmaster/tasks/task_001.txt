# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Initialize the project repository with version control and basic structure.
# Details:
Create a new Git repository for the project. Set up the initial directory structure with folders for scripts, tests, and documentation. Initialize a README file and a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control. Use GitHub or GitLab for remote repository hosting.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the repository is accessible and the initial structure is correctly set up by cloning it to a different location.
