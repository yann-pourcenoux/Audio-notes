# Title: Integrate HuggingFace Model for Transcription
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate a HuggingFace speech-to-text model for transcribing audio files.
# Details:
Use the HuggingFace Transformers library to load a pre-trained speech-to-text model like Whisper. Implement a function to transcribe normalized audio files into text. Ensure the model is compatible with the audio format produced by the loader.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the transcription accuracy by comparing the output text with known transcripts of test audio files.
