# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application.
# Details:
Use Python's logging module to implement logging at various levels (info, warning, error). Add try-except blocks to handle potential errors in file I/O, API calls, and other operations. Ensure logs are informative and help in debugging issues.

# Test Strategy:
Induce errors in a controlled environment and verify that they are logged correctly and that the application handles them gracefully.
