# Audio Notes CLI Tool - Package Structure and Testing Enhancement PRD

## Project Overview
Enhance the Audio Notes CLI tool by implementing modern Python packaging best practices and comprehensive testing strategies as outlined in the Python Packaging User Guide and pytest documentation.

## Current State Analysis
The Audio Notes project currently has:
- A functional CLI tool for audio transcription and Obsidian integration
- Basic package structure with pyproject.toml
- Some testing files but inconsistent organization
- Multiple test files scattered in the root directory

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Restructure the project following modern Python packaging best practices
2. Implement comprehensive testing strategy with proper test organization
3. Enhance CLI tool packaging and distribution capabilities
4. Establish proper development workflow and CI/CD foundations

### Success Criteria
- Clean, organized package structure following PEP standards
- Comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage
- Proper CLI entry points and packaging
- Documentation aligned with package structure
- Development environment setup automation

## Technical Requirements

### Package Structure Enhancement
- Reorganize source code following src-layout best practices
- Implement proper __init__.py files with version management
- Create proper entry points for CLI commands
- Establish clear separation between library and CLI components

### Testing Strategy Implementation
- Migrate all test files to proper tests/ directory structure
- Implement pytest configuration with proper discovery
- Create test fixtures for common scenarios
- Establish integration tests for CLI workflows
- Implement coverage reporting and thresholds

### CLI Tool Packaging
- Configure proper console_scripts entry points
- Implement CLI argument validation and error handling
- Create installable package with pip
- Support for development installations (pip install -e .)

### Development Workflow
- Setup development environment automation
- Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Create proper build and distribution workflows
- Establish version management strategy

## Functional Requirements

### Package Organization
- Move all source code to src/audio_notes/ structure
- Create proper module hierarchy
- Implement version management in __init__.py
- Setup proper imports and exports

### Testing Framework
- Comprehensive unit tests for all modules
- Integration tests for CLI workflows
- Mock external dependencies (Ollama, file system)
- Test data management and fixtures
- Performance and edge case testing

### CLI Enhancement
- Robust command-line interface with proper help
- Configuration file management
- Error handling and user feedback
- Logging and debugging capabilities

### Documentation
- Update README with installation instructions
- Create developer documentation
- Document CLI usage and examples
- API documentation for library components

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Should work with Python 3.8+
- Must support existing Obsidian integration workflow
- Should minimize external dependencies

## Implementation Approach
- Follow Python Packaging User Guide recommendations
- Use pytest for testing framework
- Implement gradual migration to avoid breaking changes
- Use modern pyproject.toml configuration
- Follow PEP 517/518 build standards

## Deliverables
1. Restructured package following src-layout
2. Comprehensive test suite in tests/ directory
3. Proper CLI packaging with entry points
4. Updated documentation and examples
5. Development environment setup scripts
6. CI/CD configuration files

## Timeline Considerations
- Phase 1: Package structure reorganization
- Phase 2: Test suite migration and enhancement
- Phase 3: CLI packaging and entry points
- Phase 4: Documentation and workflow automation

## Quality Assurance
- All tests must pass before any structural changes
- Code coverage must be maintained or improved
- CLI functionality must remain intact
- Documentation must be updated with changes

## Success Metrics
- Test coverage >90%
- All CLI commands work as expected
- Package can be installed via pip
- Development setup can be automated
- Code follows Python packaging best practices
