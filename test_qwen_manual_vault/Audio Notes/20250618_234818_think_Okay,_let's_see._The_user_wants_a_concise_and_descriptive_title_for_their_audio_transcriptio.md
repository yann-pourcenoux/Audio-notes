First, I'll check for any grammar issues. The original has some repetitive phrases, like "This is particularly important for productivity workflows..." which can be made shorter. Also, the sentence structure might be a bit clunky. For example, "This is particularly important for productivity workflows..." could be rephrased to "This is especially important for productivity workflows..." to make it more concise.
