    Hello, this is a comprehensive test of the audio notes system. 
    I'm testing the integration between OpenAI's Whisper Large-v3 model for transcription 
    and Qwen 3.0.6B via Ollama for intelligent content enhancement.
    
    The system should be able to process this audio transcription and enhance it with:
    - Intelligent title generation based on the content
    - Relevant tags for organization
    - Content summarization for quick reference
    - Proper markdown formatting for Obsidian
    
    This is particularly important for productivity workflows where users need to quickly
    process and organize their audio notes, meeting recordings, lectures, or personal voice memos.
    The AI enhancement should make the notes more searchable and better organized.
    
    Today we're discussing the implementation of machine learning models in production environments,
    focusing on the challenges of model deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. Key topics include
    containerization with Docker, orchestration with Kubernetes, and monitoring with MLflow.
