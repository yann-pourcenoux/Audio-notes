### Quality Assurance
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive end-to-end workflow testing
- ‚úÖ Error handling and edge case validation
- ‚úÖ Multi-format audio file processing verification
- ‚úÖ Ollama integration and AI enhancement testing
- ‚úÖ Obsidian vault creation and note writing validation
- ‚úÖ CLI command and option parameter testing
- ‚úÖ Performance testing with various audio lengths and formats

### Dependencies
- Python 3.12+ requirement for modern language features
- Core ML dependencies: transformers, torch, torchaudio
- Audio processing: librosa, soundfile, pydub
- AI integration: ollama (optional but recommended)
- CLI and utilities: click, tqdm, python-dotenv
- Development tools: pytest, black, isort, flake8, mypy

### Known Limitations
- AI enhancement requires Ollama service to be running locally
- GPU acceleration requires CUDA-compatible hardware and drivers
- Very short audio files (< 1 second) may produce minimal transcription
- AI-generated content quality depends on audio clarity and content complexity

### Installation Requirements
- **Minimum**: Python 3.12, basic audio processing dependencies
- **Recommended**: Ollama with Qwen 3.0.6B model for AI features
- **Optimal**: CUDA-enabled GPU for faster processing
